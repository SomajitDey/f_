          Ref: https://www.fortran90.org/src/best-practices.html
                            
Here is a style guide that we like and that seems to be prevalent 
in most scientific codes (as well as the Fortran standard library).

Free-form:

Use free-form source-code with ext .f90. Max. no. of characters per line = 132.
However, try to stay within 85. Break lines with trailing &.
                                                                                                    
Naming Convention:

1. Use lowercase for all Fortran constructs (do, subroutine, module, ...).

2. Follow short mathematical notation for mathematical variables/functions
(Ylm, Gamma, gamma, Enl, Rnl, ...).

3. For other names use all lowercase: try to keep names to one or two syllables;
if more are required, use underscores to clarify (sortpair, whitechar, meshexp, 
numstrings, linspace, meshgrid, argsort, spline, spline_interp, spline_interpolate,
stoperr, stop_error, meshexp_der). For example “spline interpolation” can be 
shortened to spline_interpolation, spline_interpolate, spline_interp, spline, but
not to splineint (“int” could mean integration, integer, etc. — too much ambiguity,
even in the clear context of a computational code). This is in contrast to 
get_argument() where getarg() is perfectly clean and clear.

The above are general guidelines. In general, choosing the right name certainly 
depends on the word being truncated as to whether the first syllable is sufficient. 
Usually it is but clearly not always. Thus some thought should go into step “try to
keep names to 2 syllables or less” since it can really affect the indicativeness and
simplicity. Simple consistent naming rules are a real help in this regard – for both
collaboration and for one’s own sanity when going back to some old code you haven’t 
seen in while.

Indentation:

Use 4 spaces indentation (set your source-code editor to put 4 Spaces when you press
Tab).

Comma, :: , Operators(+/=/.AND./.NOT./> etc.), => :

1. Every comma should be followed by a single space. 
2. :: in declarations should have a space on each side.
3. Operators should not have space on any side. Use > instead of .gt. and /= instead of .ne.
4. The pointer assignment => should have space on both sides. 

Other Advisories:

Use dowhile, elseif instead of do while and else if.

Do not put space between a procedure name and the following brackets.
